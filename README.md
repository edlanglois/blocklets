# Blocklets
Blocklets for i3blocks

## I3Blocks Configuration
These blocklets require `markup=pango` and `interval=persist` in their i3blocks
configurations.

## Icons
These blocklets use icons from the free
[Font Awesome v5](https://fontawesome.com/v5.0/icons) font.
As an alternative, icons can be specified with `ICON_<NAME>` environment
variables.

If the `ICON_COLOUR` environment variable is set (to a colour name like `cyan`
or an RGB(A) code like `#00FFFF`) then the icon will be coloured accordingly.
